# EnCodec implementation
My implementation of the Encodec architecture from the paper [High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13438).

# Why an another implementation?

I made this code to learn the basis of audio in AI and practice my skill in deep learning. There is a lot of chance that the implementation is wrong so I do not recommend using it, it's just a student project.

# What I use to build the project

I used the "High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression" paper but also a lot of external resources like:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV7bhf6b2Hs
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2BS70rDVwk

You can take a look on the resource.

# Training

You just have to follow these two steps

1. Install modules:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run the training script: `python3 train.py`
